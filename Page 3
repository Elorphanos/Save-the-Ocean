<p>Everything you do makes a difference, so here are ways you can stop pollution in your everyday life. Reduce the use of single-use products like plastic bottles. Recycle properly so trash does not end up in the ocean. <br>
Encourage others to recycle and reduce the use of single-use products. Stop using products with microbeads. Microbeads, which are often used in exfoliating face washes, are not biodegradable, so they can end up in oceans. <p>

<p align= "center" >Leaving your car at home when you can and being conscious of your energy consumption. Use compact fluorescent light bulbs. Take the stairs. Bundle up or use a fan to not overset your thermostat. Use a reusable water bottle.  <br>
 Store food in non disposable containers. Bring your own cloth tote or a reusable bag when shopping. Recycle whenever possible. Clean up after yourself when you are diving, surfing, or relaxing on the beach. Do not remove rocks or coral from your beach environment.  <br>
 Encourage others to respect the environment. Avoid buying items such as coral jewelry, tortoise shell hair accessories, and shark products.  <p>
